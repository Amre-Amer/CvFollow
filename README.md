| `- Shows simple tracking logic.`                              |
| `- Shows simple blob logic.`                              |
| `- Mono screen that tracks greenest pixel.`|
| `- Lines are from camera to screen pixel. `                     |
| `- Allows exploring the following:`                            |
| `    * what happens when no target found`           |
| `    * smoothing for pixel location. `|
| `    * smoothing for neck rotation. `|
| `- Further study:`                                           |
| `    * add more body parts.`                        |
| `    * add mass`                                             |
